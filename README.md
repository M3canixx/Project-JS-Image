# Project-JS-Image

This is an image sort algorithm... Obviously.

## Description

Put your images in the random_pic folder. The algorithm will only sort files with .jpg extension. Otherwise, the files will stay in this folder and not be deleted.

You can change the initial folder by changing the variable pathinit with your path where you stock your images.

The algorithm creates folders, renames your jpg files, and moves it to the right folder.

It will also display some informations such as : the original size of the image or the size of the detection box in a JSON file.
